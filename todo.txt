Tasks:
- ALI
- Check S(0) / B(0) ~ sqrt(eps)
- Other testing, making plots
- Write up
- Ng acceleration?
- Generalize quad weights/points (or get 32 weights/points somehow)


Lines:
- Specify lorentzian/gaussian/etc in line list
- Make line list more robust
- Convert to using log(gf) system -> calc tau from z and alpha
- Feature struct to lineProfiles


Misc:
- Carry over S for nearby wavelength points for faster convergence
- Look into q(tau) for temperature calculation


Problems to address:
- Temperature of spectrum/BB is at tau = 0? Should T profile be corrected for it
  to be at T_eff
- S/B > 1 near depth
