Tasks:
- Write up
- Ng acceleration
- Generalize quad weights/points


Lines:
- Specify lorentzian/gaussian/etc in line list
- Make line list more robust
- Convert to using log(gf) system -> calc tau from z and alpha
- Feature struct to lineProfiles


Problems to address:
- Formal solution issue with depth-dependent B(tau)
- Small tau_min does not seem to like when Dtau is not strictly increasing
