Tasks:
- Check S(0) / B(0) ~ sqrt(eps)
- Check for convergence with S(0) / B(0) ~ sqrt(eps)
- Other testing, making plots
- Write up
- Ng acceleration?
- Generalize quad weights/points


Lines:
- Specify lorentzian/gaussian/etc in line list
- Make line list more robust
- Convert to using log(gf) system -> calc tau from z and alpha
- Feature struct to lineProfiles


Problems to address:
- Temperature of spectrum/BB is at tau = 0? Should T profile be corrected for it
  to be at T_eff
